As I pursue a future in computer science, I've explored various projects to test my knowledge and satisfy my curiosity. Among my attempts, Iâ€™ve successfully completed three notable projects, with the most impressive being a game I developed using Unity. To experience the game, extract the folder and run the application named "Penguin Invasion." The scripts are accessible if you download Unity and open the project. Feel free to try out the game yourself or explore.
